## Short Bio

*   I am Guoyu, now a student from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science. This is my first year in ICT and I am majoring in computer architecture.
*   My research interests include: hardware accelerators design and drivers in operating systems, chip agile design, chip gate-level fault simulation(in DFT).
*   In addition to academics, I love and be proficient in the development of web front-end. There are many open source projects on [my Github](https://github.com/dorapocket), and I have also contributed to many open source front-end frameworks.
*   Intern at Tencent WeChat Group, responsible for Linux-based WeChat and Linux porting of miniprograms. Also intern in Alipay, responsible for payment business and client development.

## Education
*   University of Chinese Academy of Science (2021-2024) @ ICT,CAS , Computer Architecture
*   Hangzhou Dianzi University (2018-2021) , Computer Science

## Researchs
*   [LUT-DLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10658): Lookup Table as Efficient Extreme Low-Bit Deep Learning Accelerator

## Some Engineering...
*   ICTEST - Fault simulation tools
    *   Written in C++, implementing event-driven fault simulation in DFT stage.
*   FPGA fault simulation accelerator
    *   A GPU-like arch. Building accelerator in PL, control it in PS via AXI.
*   SaltDog - A paper management App ( self-project )
    *   A plug-in, extensible research paper management system. It has higher security and a more modular API than Zotero. Self-developed PDF reader that supports editing and PDF exporting.
*   Wechat Miniprogram library ( Intern in Wechat )
    *   Linux porting of Wechat Miniprogram base library. It is currently implemented in most IoT devices that support WeChat .
